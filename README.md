# HBScore - A suite of handbell music authoring and display tools
This repository contains a WinForms application for authoring handbell music, plus a second WinForms program for displaying
handbell music on a tablet with easy page navigation. The application suite only runs on Windows at present.

## HBMusicCreator
This program allows you to author handbell music using a note letter in squares format as used by a number of handbell groups where stave notation is not preferred.

## DisplayScore
This program allows you to fill the screen of your tablet or PC a page at a time with the music you are playing, so that you need not print out and spread
lots of sheets of paper along your handbell table. Tapping the right half of the screen with a finger (tablets) or clicking a mouse in the right half
of the screen advances the display one page of music. Tapping in (most of) the left half of the screen goes back a page. Tapping in the top left corner brings up a context menu
with menu items big enough to poke with your finger if using a tablet. These allow you to rewind to the first page of music, or the quit the program.
